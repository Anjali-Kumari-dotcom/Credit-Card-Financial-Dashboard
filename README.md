# Credit Card Financial Dashboard Project


## Project Overview
The Credit Card Financial Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool that provides insights into customer transactions, revenue, expenditure, and demographic trends. The dashboard is designed to help financial analysts, business executives, and marketing teams make data-driven decisions regarding credit card usage, customer segmentation, and revenue streams.

## Objectives
Monitor Revenue & Income Trends: Track revenue, interest earned, and transaction amounts over time.

Analyze Customer Segmentation: Understand customer demographics based on age, gender, job, education, and marital status.

Evaluate Transaction Behaviors: Identify how customers use credit cards (swipe, chip, online) and spending patterns across different categories.

Assess Card Category Performance: Compare revenue, transaction amounts, and interest earned for different credit card categories (Gold, Silver, Blue, Platinum).

Geographical Insights: Determine top-performing states for credit card revenue generation.

Customer Acquisition & Retention: Analyze customer acquisition costs and dependent counts to understand long-term retention strategies.

Quarterly Performance Review: Track revenue and transaction counts across different quarters to identify seasonal trends.
